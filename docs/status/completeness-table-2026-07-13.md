# Per-subsystem completeness table — 2026-07-13

## Method (evidence-first)

1. **Manifest sweep** — compiled all 49 `sb/manifest/*` modules, ran every
   `ENSURE_REFS` hook (the live root's plugin-host re-arm path), then resolved
   every declared route: **413 commands, 370 panel actions, 57 selectors,
   ~200 panels. Zero unregistered refs** — every declared surface has a
   registered callable (no `RefUnresolved` anywhere; the band-5 bug-1 class is
   dead: role pending terminals now register at module import,
   `sb/domain/role/handlers.py:579`).
2. **Pending-terminal classification** — handlers whose name or body carries
   the declared-honest refusal pattern (`operator_spine.pending_handler`,
   "aren't armed in this build", the deep-systems successor-decision marker)
   were flagged and hand-verified;
   false positives (e.g. `btd6.cmd_strat_pending` = the LIVE staff
   review-queue read, `sb/domain/btd6/oracle_surface.py:332`;
   `mining.stats_view` = live) were reclassified by reading the source.
   Net: **27 pending commands, 89 pending actions, 13 pending selectors** —
   all polite declared terminals, none silent.
3. **Marker scan** — `rg -g '!bootstrap.py' -g '!.substrate' -n
   'TODO|FIXME|NotImplemented|stub|not implemented|coming soon|WIP'` over
   `sb/` + `tests/`: no TODO/FIXME in product code; `placeholder` hits are the
   UI select property (benign); the one `NotImplementedError`
   (`sb/kernel/interaction/resolve.py:89`) is the default panel-engine port
   replaced at composition (benign); `casino/service.py:99` "Roulette is
   coming soon!" is the SHIPPED byte (oracle parity, not a gap class).
4. **Error-path spot-checks** — channel ops (17 commands, real failure copy on
   every branch, `sb/domain/channel/handlers.py`), cleanup history scan
   (honest `HistoryReaderNotInstalled` refusal, `handlers.py:114`), mining
   argful refusals (`service.py:420,939`), moderation/role/channel live-effect
   adapters exist (`sb/adapters/discord/{moderation,role,channel}_actions.py`)
   — the band-2/5 "not installed" degrades are armed code paths now. The
   band-5 live-leg copy bugs (record-shape acks, `WorkflowResult` repr leak)
   no longer grep in `sb/domain/role/`.
5. **Parity picture** — all 48 subsystem rows + kernel are `ported`
   (`parity/parity.yml:166-241`); coverage debt list is 0 rows
   (`docs/status/coverage-debt-2026-07-12.md`); remaining depth exemptions are
   the named `guard-only-capture` / `modal-driven` / `select-driven` /
   env-keyed classes, each with its exit condition ledgered in `parity.yml`.

## Column key

- **core** — the user-facing primary surface (commands + gameplay panels).
- **admin** — staff/operator surface (admin commands, hub mutation actions).
- **setup** — configuration surface (settings pages, config panels, wizard).
- ✅ = every declared surface in the column routes to a live handler (with
  evidence); ⚑ = declared-honest pending terminals or gating remain (cited).

**Headline counts (50 rows):** core **42 ✅ / 8 ⚑** · admin **43 ✅ / 7 ⚑** ·
setup **47 ✅ / 3 ⚑** *(setup-row core flipped ✅ by the wizard-lifecycle
slice, ORDER 017 night-run; its setup column stays ⚑ for the named
successors)*. Every flag is a *declared-honest* terminal or an
in-flight/owner-gated lane — the sweep found **zero silent gaps** (no
unregistered refs, no empty-string error paths).

## In-flight peer lanes (flagged, NOT worked here)

- mining write-parity **WP-2 (#312)** / **WP-3 (#317)** — vault + depth/world/
  wear write goldens (stacked; retire the remaining `guard-only-capture` rows).
- mining **energy domain core (#320)** — unblocks the `!cook`/`!use` terminals;
  dig-gating awaits an owner decision, sequenced after WP-3.
- **fishing slice 1 (#313)** — owner-gated (the deep-systems successor decision); its pending block is
  the lane's scope.
- settings-hub group-select navigation — claimed
  (`control/claims/operator-hubs-interactive.md`, 2026-07-12).

## Top gaps (ranked, worst first — the night's fix-slice driver)

1. **fishing deep systems** — 15/20 commands + 6 panel actions pending
   (`sb/manifest/fishing.py` → `operator_spine`); the single largest pending
   block in the fleet. **Owner-gated (#313, the deep-systems successor decision) — needs owner go, not a
   free slice.**
2. ~~**setup wizard interior**~~ — **DONE** (wizard-lifecycle slice, ORDER
   017 night-run): the 10 counted actions + selector + `/setup-skip` armed
   (`sb/domain/setup/wizard.py`). Remaining named successors (smaller, now
   individually sliceable): essential steps 2–8 · the 10 per-section flows ·
   the suggestion Edit lane · the final-review apply lane.
3. **mining argful write faces** — `!skill` spend (WP-5), argful
   `!build`/`!craft` (WP-6), `!cook`/`!use` (energy, #320), 12 panel-button
   writes; **partially in-flight — only WP-5/WP-6 slices are free AFTER
   WP-2/WP-3 land** (same tables re-freezing).
4. **settings access/audit admin surface** — 9 actions + 2 selectors pending
   (command-access matrix, audit view, health chips); the settings hub
   advertises controls that all refuse. Adjacent to the
   `operator-hubs-interactive` claim — coordinate before starting.
5. **diagnostic operator mutations** — **DONE** (ORDER 017 fix slice, the
   PR that updates this row): 10 actions + 2 selectors implemented (flag
   manager, automation panel, process-state trio, cmdlist paging;
   `sb/domain/diagnostic/handlers.py` carries zero `*_pending` routes).
6. **operator-hub admin action cluster** — cleanup words panel (8),
   server_management hub (6), channel hub (5), admin cogmgr (7), utility
   panel (4), xp config (4), counters preset (1), role create (1): ~36
   pending actions whose command twins are mostly live — a
   wire-clicks-to-existing-ops family. Coordinate with the
   `operator-hubs-interactive` claim (read-only nav slice already claimed;
   the EDIT controls are explicitly deferred to a settings-mutation-style
   slice). **PARTIALLY DONE (ORDER 017 night-run): operator-hub edits C
   (this PR) arms the cogmgr select + windowing and reclassifies the
   deploy trio by-design; edits B (#356, merged) delivered the channel
   hub's five sub-panel flows; edits A (#358, in flight — supersedes
   #355) covers utility Poll/Remind/420 + role Create + counter-preset
   apply; peers own xp config (#345), cleanup words (#333),
   server_management nav trio + utility Invite (#332). Remaining free:
   server_management access_map/help_preview/help_editor (a 2.3k-line
   oracle projection pair — its own slice).**
7. **btd6 paragon calculator** — 3 actions + 4 selectors pending
   (`btd6.paragon_pending`); a self-contained pure-compute port
   (`sb/domain/btd6/service.py`). Free.
8. **ticket setup panel** — 3 actions + 2 selectors pending
   (`ticket.setup_pending`); command twins (`!ticketsetup` family) live. Free.
9. **rps bot-match deep flow** — `!rpsbot` pending
   (`sb/domain/rps/handlers.py:613`); interactive match orchestration. Free.
10. **hermes egress adapter** — work-order send unarmed
    (`sb/domain/hermes/handlers.py:19`). Small; likely env/owner-keyed.
11. **starboard threshold modal** — ✅ DONE (ORDER 017 night-run slice C):
    the shipped `_ThresholdModal` G-10 form armed over the audited
    `starboard.configure` op; the pending terminal retired.
12. **ai NL live lane** — env-gated on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (owner action, not
    a code slice); `ai_review_log` first row-bearing golden lands with an
    NL-armed capture (`parity.yml:361`).
