# Per-subsystem completeness table — 2026-07-13

> **Status:** `audit` — ORDER 017 item 1 (owner NIGHT-RUN mandate, PR #323).
> Point-in-time inventory @ main `b8fcdb7`; drives the night's fix slices via
> the "Top gaps" ranking at the bottom. Regenerate rather than amend.

## Method (evidence-first)

1. **Manifest sweep** — compiled all 49 `sb/manifest/*` modules, ran every
   `ENSURE_REFS` hook (the live root's plugin-host re-arm path), then resolved
   every declared route: **413 commands, 370 panel actions, 57 selectors,
   ~200 panels. Zero unregistered refs** — every declared surface has a
   registered callable (no `RefUnresolved` anywhere; the band-5 bug-1 class is
   dead: role pending terminals now register at module import,
   `sb/domain/role/handlers.py:579`).
2. **Pending-terminal classification** — handlers whose name or body carries
   the declared-honest refusal pattern (`operator_spine.pending_handler`,
   "aren't armed in this build", the deep-systems successor-decision marker)
   were flagged and hand-verified;
   false positives (e.g. `btd6.cmd_strat_pending` = the LIVE staff
   review-queue read, `sb/domain/btd6/oracle_surface.py:332`;
   `mining.stats_view` = live) were reclassified by reading the source.
   Net: **27 pending commands, 89 pending actions, 13 pending selectors** —
   all polite declared terminals, none silent.
3. **Marker scan** — `rg -g '!bootstrap.py' -g '!.substrate' -n
   'TODO|FIXME|NotImplemented|stub|not implemented|coming soon|WIP'` over
   `sb/` + `tests/`: no TODO/FIXME in product code; `placeholder` hits are the
   UI select property (benign); the one `NotImplementedError`
   (`sb/kernel/interaction/resolve.py:89`) is the default panel-engine port
   replaced at composition (benign); `casino/service.py:99` "Roulette is
   coming soon!" is the SHIPPED byte (oracle parity, not a gap class).
4. **Error-path spot-checks** — channel ops (17 commands, real failure copy on
   every branch, `sb/domain/channel/handlers.py`), cleanup history scan
   (honest `HistoryReaderNotInstalled` refusal, `handlers.py:114`), mining
   argful refusals (`service.py:420,939`), moderation/role/channel live-effect
   adapters exist (`sb/adapters/discord/{moderation,role,channel}_actions.py`)
   — the band-2/5 "not installed" degrades are armed code paths now. The
   band-5 live-leg copy bugs (record-shape acks, `WorkflowResult` repr leak)
   no longer grep in `sb/domain/role/`.
5. **Parity picture** — all 48 subsystem rows + kernel are `ported`
   (`parity/parity.yml:166-241`); coverage debt list is 0 rows
   (`docs/status/coverage-debt-2026-07-12.md`); remaining depth exemptions are
   the named `guard-only-capture` / `modal-driven` / `select-driven` /
   env-keyed classes, each with its exit condition ledgered in `parity.yml`.

## Column key

- **core** — the user-facing primary surface (commands + gameplay panels).
- **admin** — staff/operator surface (admin commands, hub mutation actions).
- **setup** — configuration surface (settings pages, config panels, wizard).
- ✅ = every declared surface in the column routes to a live handler (with
  evidence); ⚑ = declared-honest pending terminals or gating remain (cited).

**Headline counts (49 rows — evening true-up recount 2026-07-13 at HEAD,
after #332/#333/#408/#410/#411 landed):** core **44 ✅ / 5 ⚑** (ai ·
casino · cleanup · hermes · mining) · admin **46 ✅ / 3 ⚑** (btd6 ·
settings · utility) · setup **47 ✅ / 2 ⚑**
(setup · xp) *(the original "50 rows" counted the header line; per-slice
flip annotations consolidated into the morning recount, rows
server_management/cleanup/fishing trued up this evening)*. Every flag is a *declared-honest* terminal or an
in-flight/owner-gated lane — the sweep found **zero silent gaps** (no
unregistered refs, no empty-string error paths).

## In-flight peer lanes (flagged, NOT worked here)

- mining write-parity **WP-2 (#312)** / **WP-3 (#317)** — vault + depth/world/
  wear write goldens (stacked; retire the remaining `guard-only-capture` rows);
  **WP-5 (#335)** / **WP-6 (#344)** now open behind them (skill-spend +
  structure-build write goldens).
- mining **energy domain core (#320)** — unblocks the `!cook`/`!use` terminals;
  dig-gating awaits an owner decision, sequenced after WP-3.
- ~~**fishing slice 1 (#313)**~~ — **MERGED** (morning true-up 2026-07-13):
  the whole fishing lane landed overnight — slices 1–4 (#313/#330/#342/#350),
  claim closed (#353).
- settings-hub group-select navigation — claimed
  (`control/claims/operator-hubs-interactive.md`, 2026-07-12).

## Top gaps (ranked, worst first — the night's fix-slice driver)

1. ~~**fishing deep systems**~~ — **DONE** (fishing port lane, ORDER 017
   night-run; morning true-up 2026-07-13): slices 1–4 merged
   (#313/#330/#342/#350; claim closed #353) — all 20 shipped fishing
   commands ported, the deep-system `PENDING` roster is empty
   (`sb/domain/fishing/service.py:720`). Residue trued up (evening
   2026-07-13): the 🎣 how-to-fish hub guide is DONE — #410 routes it to
   the live rules card and retires `fishing.howtofish_pending`. Cast-leg
   residue trued up (night 2026-07-13, verified in code at HEAD): the
   venue/rod/bait/gear/structure/weather → cast wiring is LIVE (#373 —
   write goldens #387, claim closed #389); the only parked residue is
   the parked real-time minigame rung (bite-delay/fake-out/reel-fight
   timing — knobs computed + surfaced but never gating a catch) + the
   `_FishingDoneView` Cast-again continuation, per the service
   PENDING-roster note (`sb/domain/fishing/service.py:1032`).
2. ~~**setup wizard interior**~~ — **DONE** (wizard-lifecycle slice, ORDER
   017 night-run): the 10 counted actions + selector + `/setup-skip` armed
   (`sb/domain/setup/wizard.py`). The final-review apply lane is ALSO DONE
   (final-review slice, `sb/domain/setup/final_review.py`), and the
   essential steps 2–8 are ALSO DONE (essential-steps slice,
   `sb/domain/setup/essential_steps.py` — the guided spine, summary,
   extras, health check + restart-resume bridge), and the suggestion
   Edit lane is ALSO DONE (suggestion-edit slice — the rename modal +
   bind explanation in `wizard.py`/`panels.py`), and the section-flow
   spine + linear wizard steps + the preset_select/channels flows are
   ALSO DONE (section-flows slice 4 — `section_card.py`,
   `wizard_nav.py`, `preset_select.py`, `channels.py`), and ALL TEN
   per-section flows are ALSO DONE (settings-write slice 5 —
   `logging_presets.py`/`moderation.py`/`cleanup.py`; roles-family
   slice 6 — `roles.py`/`role_templates.py`; routing-ticket slice 7 —
   `cog_routing.py`/`ticket.py`; **the setup-wizard successor lane is
   CLOSED**). Surviving follow-ups (individually sliceable, none a
   wizard terminal): the role/channel-create + routing K9→K7 compound
   ops (staged rows apply fail-closed as skipped) · the on-ready
   resume sweep (app-boot seam) · the automation-rule apply seam · the
   recovery-view/notice rides · the native channel-recommender port ·
   the windowed-select grammar successor.
3. **mining argful write faces** — `!skill` spend (WP-5, **PR #335 open**),
   argful `!build`/`!craft` (WP-6, **PR #344 open**), `!cook`/`!use`
   (energy, #320), 12 panel-button writes; **fully in-flight — WP-5/WP-6
   are now open PRs stacked behind WP-2 (#312) / WP-3 (#317)** (same
   tables re-freezing).
4. **settings access/audit admin surface** — 9 actions + 2 selectors pending
   (command-access matrix, audit view, health chips); the settings hub
   advertises controls that all refuse. Adjacent to the
   `operator-hubs-interactive` claim — coordinate before starting.
5. **diagnostic operator mutations** — **DONE** (ORDER 017 fix slice, the
   PR that updates this row): 10 actions + 2 selectors implemented (flag
   manager, automation panel, process-state trio, cmdlist paging;
   `sb/domain/diagnostic/handlers.py` carries zero `*_pending` routes).
6. **operator-hub admin action cluster** — cleanup words panel (8),
   server_management hub (6), channel hub (5), admin cogmgr (7), utility
   panel (4), xp config (4), counters preset (1), role create (1): ~36
   pending actions whose command twins are mostly live — a
   wire-clicks-to-existing-ops family. Coordinate with the
   `operator-hubs-interactive` claim (read-only nav slice already claimed;
   the EDIT controls are explicitly deferred to a settings-mutation-style
   slice). **PARTIALLY DONE (ORDER 017 night-run): operator-hub edits A
   (this PR, #358 — supersedes #355) delivers utility Poll/Remind modal
   ingress + the 420 forward, role.hub Create over the live createrole
   lane, and the argful counter-preset apply; edits B (#356, merged)
   delivered the channel hub's five sub-panel flows; edits C (#357,
   merged) armed the cogmgr select + windowing and reclassified the
   deploy trio by-design; peers own xp config (#345), cleanup words
   (#333), server_management nav trio + utility Invite (#332).
   Remaining free: ~~server_management access_map/help_preview/
   help_editor~~ — ✅ DONE (ORDER 017 night-run follow-up, projections
   slices A/B/C: #362 + the help-preview + help-editor PRs; D-0087/

   moderation/roles/cleanup~~ — ✅ DONE (evening true-up 2026-07-13):
   #332 routes the trio to the ported `moderation.hub`/`role.hub`/
   `cleanup.hub`, and the cleanup hub itself is now fully armed
   (#333 words/logging · #408 settings/anti-evasion · #411 policies —
   zero cleanup pendings remain).**
7. **btd6 paragon calculator** — ✅ DONE (ORDER 017 night-run slice A):
   the 3 actions + 4 selectors armed as the pure-compute port
   (`sb/domain/btd6/paragon_panel.py`); `btd6.paragon_pending` retired.
8. **ticket setup panel** — ✅ DONE (ORDER 017 night-run slice B): the
   3 actions + 2 selectors armed over the audited config/channel ops
   (`sb/domain/ticket/setup_panel.py`); `ticket.setup_pending` retired.
9. ~~**rps bot-match deep flow**~~ — **DONE** (ORDER 017 night-run fix
   slice): `!rpsbot` armed end-to-end — shipped guards + copy verbatim,
   one bot-match button view per player (the tournament port's ledgered
   home-channel deviation), best-of scoring, per-round stats on the
   audited `rps.bot_round` op (`sb/domain/rps/bot_match.py`).
10. **hermes egress adapter** — work-order send unarmed
    (`sb/domain/hermes/handlers.py:19`). **Probed 2026-07-13 (rps-bot-match
    slice, evidence in docs/CAPABILITIES.md): env/owner-keyed, NOT a free
    slice.** The transmit leg is a small un-ported code slice (the oracle's
    ~40-line aiohttp POST, `disbot/cogs/hermes_cog.py:44-81`), but it sits
    behind DORMANT owner credentials `CLAUDE_ROUTINE_FIRE_URL` +
    `CLAUDE_ROUTINE_TOKEN` (`sb/spec/config.py:197-204`) — both absent in
    the build env (`bridge_configured() == False`; one-shot attempt →
    verbatim `RuntimeError: missing_config`). Unverifiable live until the
    owner keys the env — sequence the port WITH the owner keying.
11. **starboard threshold modal** — ✅ DONE (ORDER 017 night-run slice C):
    the shipped `_ThresholdModal` G-10 form armed over the audited
    `starboard.configure` op; the pending terminal retired.
12. **ai NL live lane** — env-gated on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (owner action, not
    a code slice); `ai_review_log` first row-bearing golden lands with an
    NL-armed capture (`parity.yml:361`).
