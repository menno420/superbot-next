"""Four-twenty content pools — the shipped random-pick surface
(disbot/cogs/four_twenty_cog.py over disbot/data/json/
four_twenty_content.json).

Provenance discipline (the general/content.py lane): every entry below is
verified VERBATIM against the oracle (menno420/superbot,
data/json/four_twenty_content.json — reconstructed fragment-by-fragment via
code search; the fragments tile the whole file, head "Be like the river"
through the closing "24 divisors" entry). The shipped empty-pool fallback
copy is ``f"No {label} available right now."`` (four_twenty_cog.py `_pick`
— note the trailing "right now.", which general_cog.py's twin lacks). No
golden pins any pool entry (the single four_twenty golden opens the panel
and clicks nothing).
