"""Heuristic: does a reply to one of the bot's AI answers read as a
*correction*? — the shipped ``utils/ai_correction_cues.py`` @7f7628e1,
verbatim (patterns, anchors, docnotes).

Used by the review-loop correction observer (sb/domain/ai/review.py) to
decide whether a member's reply to a bot AI answer should be logged as a
correction (the owner's "react AND reply" detection). Deliberately
conservative — a follow-up question or a thanks is not a correction.
Pure, stdlib-only.
