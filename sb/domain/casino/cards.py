"""Reusable standard-52-card-deck primitives (band 6, ported VERBATIM
from the shipped ``utils/cards/__init__.py``) — pure, Discord-free.

Blackjack ships its own card helpers in ``services/blackjack_engine.py``, but
those are blackjack-specific: cards are bare ``"<rank> <suit>"`` strings and the
only "value" is the blackjack face value (A=11, demote on bust).  Poker — and
any future casino game that needs to *rank and compare* cards — needs a real,
ordered card model: an ace that sorts high (or low in a wheel straight), suits
that matter for flushes, and value-comparable cards.

This module is that shared model.  It is intentionally pure: stdlib only, no
Discord, fully deterministic except :func:`make_deck` (which shuffles).  Pass a
pre-built deck to keep tests reproducible.

Public API
----------
- :class:`Suit` — the four suits with their glyphs.
- :class:`Card` — a frozen ``(rank, suit)`` value object; ``rank`` is an int
  2..14 (J=11, Q=12, K=13, A=14) so cards compare and sort by strength.
- :data:`RANKS`, :data:`SUITS` — the alphabets.
- :func:`make_deck` — a fresh 52-card deck (shuffled unless ``shuffle=False``).
- :func:`card` / :func:`parse_card` — build a card from a short code (``"AS"``,
  ``"10H"``, ``"TD"``).
