"""Texas Hold'em game engine — pure state machine, Discord-free.

Ported VERBATIM from the shipped ``utils/poker/engine.py`` — only the two
import paths changed (``utils.cards`` → ``sb.domain.casino.cards`` and
``utils.poker.evaluate`` → ``sb.domain.casino.evaluate``; the aboard modules
expose the same ``Card`` / ``make_deck`` and ``HandRank`` / ``best_hand``
names, so no symbol rename was needed) plus one non-behavioral addition: the
:meth:`PokerGame.snapshot` / :meth:`PokerGame.to_state` serializable
table-state reader (the clean headless shape downstream goldens / the
table-flow layer consume).

The betting/pot semantics are the oracle's, with **two deliberate deviations**
(both chip-allocation correctness fixes of the same family — uncalled money is
returned to its contributor, never burned or mis-awarded — not payout/balance
changes):

1. **Showdown dead side-pot layer** — in :meth:`_settle_showdown`, a side-pot
   layer reached only by *folded* players (no un-folded contender is eligible
   to win it) is **refunded to its contributors** instead of being silently
   dropped.  The oracle burns that uncalled money, so a chip can vanish — e.g.
   stacks ``P0=1, P1=1, P2=3`` with a folded all-in blind leaves a 1-chip
   orphan layer, breaking ``sum(winnings) == pot_total``.

2. **Uncontested-award over-collection** — in :meth:`_award_uncontested` (the
   everyone-folds path), the lone survivor collects from each other
   contributor only the chips that contributor **matched** against the
   survivor's own contribution; a folded player's unmatched over-commit is
   **refunded**.  The oracle awards the full ``pot_total`` here, so a survivor
   who is all-in for less than a folded opponent posted is handed the
   opponent's unmatched chip — e.g. heads-up ``P0=1, P1=3`` where ``P0`` posts
   the small blind all-in for 1 and ``P1`` posts the big blind (2) then folds
   facing nothing to call: the oracle gives ``P0`` all 3 chips, but table
   stakes cap ``P0`` at 2 (own 1 + 1 matched) with ``P1``'s extra blind chip
   refunded.  The two paths are disjoint (exactly one runs per hand), so there
   is no double-refund.

⚑ Both bugs almost certainly exist upstream in the oracle (the uncontested
path carries the same defect) and should be flagged to the Ideas Lab / fixed
upstream — the coordinator is tracking those upstream fixes on the owner's
Ideas Lab queue.  This port cannot faithfully carry a chip-mis-allocation bug
into a play-money table.

Owns one poker *table* of seated players and drives a hand through its betting
rounds (preflop → flop → turn → river → showdown), including blinds, the
big-blind option, all-ins, and **side pots**.  It holds no Discord objects and
is fully deterministic given a deck — so the betting/pot logic is unit-tested in
isolation and the view layer is a thin renderer over it.

v1 uses **table play-chips**, not the real economy: every seat starts with an
equal stack and chips never leave the table.  Real-coin buy-ins would need
N-party escrow through ``game_wager_workflow`` (a money-safety follow-up), kept
out of v1 on purpose.

Simplification (documented, casual-play): a short all-in that raises the bet by
less than a full ``min_raise`` still reopens the action for players who already
acted.  Strict casino rule caps re-raise rights in that case; the difference
only matters in multi-way all-in re-raise spots and is acceptable for a
play-chip game.
