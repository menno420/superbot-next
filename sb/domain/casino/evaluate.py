"""Poker hand evaluation (band 6, ported VERBATIM from the shipped
``utils/poker/evaluate.py`` — only the import path changed) — pure,
deterministic, Discord-free.

Scores a 5-card poker hand into a totally-ordered, comparable value and finds
the best 5-card hand out of 5, 6, or 7 cards (so it serves both 5-card draw and
Texas Hold'em's 7-card showdown).

Correctness over cleverness: :func:`best_hand` brute-forces all
``C(n, 5)`` 5-card combinations and takes the max.  For 7 cards that is 21
combinations — trivial, and obviously correct (no bit-twiddling lookup tables to
get subtly wrong).

The score is a tuple ``(category, *tiebreakers)`` where bigger is better, so two
hands compare with plain ``<``/``>``/``==``.  This makes ties (identical score)
detectable for split pots.

Public API
----------
- :class:`HandCategory` — the nine ranking categories.
- :func:`score_five` — score exactly five cards → :class:`HandRank`.
- :func:`best_hand` — best 5-of-n → :class:`HandRank`.
