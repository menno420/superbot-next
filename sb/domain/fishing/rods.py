"""The fishing rod ladder — the second, orthogonal progression axis
(band 6, D-0043 slice 2).

The shipped ``utils/fishing/rods.py`` ported (oracle menno420/superbot @
cdb26804; owner design Q-0175). The design's two-axis model: **fishing
level** (``game_xp``) gates *what* you can catch — the size bands; **the
rod** gates *how well / which-within-band* you catch it, via five knobs
the design sim tuned:

* ``window_bonus``    — seconds added to the reaction window (fairness);
* ``bite_speed``      — multiplier on the bite wait (<1 = faster = pacing);
* ``rarity_pull``     — >1 biases the catch toward the big end of the band;
* ``escape_resist``   — 0…1 reduces the reel-fight snap-free chance;
* ``premature_grace`` — 0…1 chance a premature reel is forgiven (once/cast).

Crucially the **starter rod still catches fine** — rods make fishing
*nicer and more rewarding*, never *possible* ("gear is never required").
Rods are **bought with coins** (a finite sink) — each tier requires the
one below it — or **crafted from caught fish** (the slow, gameplay-native
path): a :class:`RodRecipe` consumes ``fish_count`` caught fish whose
``size_rank`` is ``≤ max_size_rank`` (smallest-first, the shared
bait/charm spend planner in ``sb/domain/fishing/crafting.py``) and raises
the owned tier by one.

Pure + stdlib-only (no Discord, no DB) — values verbatim. The purchase /
craft writes live on the audited fishing ops (``sb/domain/fishing/ops.py``)."""
