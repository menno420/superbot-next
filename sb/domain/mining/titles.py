"""Titles — pure, table-driven earned-title model (ported verbatim from the
oracle ``disbot/utils/mining/titles.py``, brainstorm §7.6 identity).

The cheapest identity feature: earned, equippable text titles. Each title is
**derived** from existing progression — skill mastery (a branch at its cap),
depth milestones (the deepest biome reached), and game-level milestones — so
nothing new has to be *granted* on a mutation path: a player's earned set is a
pure function of state they already have (:class:`TitleContext`). Only the
player's *equipped choice* is persisted (``mining_player_state.equipped_title``).

Pure + stdlib-only (no Discord / DB / state), like
:mod:`sb.domain.mining.skills` and :mod:`sb.domain.mining.equipment`, so the
catalogue and earn checks are trivially unit-tested and shared across layers.
