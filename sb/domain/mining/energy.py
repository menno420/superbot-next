"""Mining energy — the playable-pace "fuel" for digging (pure domain).

Energy is the frequency brake the owner chose **instead of a per-dig cooldown**
(2026-06-22): each dig spends energy, energy refills passively over time, and
food / boosters top it up.  It is sized to the sim-pinned ~360-digs-per-active-
hour sustained throttle (``docs/planning/mining-economy-balance-2026-06-22.md``)
— a full bar is a short burst, after which you regen ~1 unit / ``REGEN_SECONDS``
(= 360 / hour), so the faucet lands in line with the rest of the economy without
making every action wait.  Food and boosters let an active player keep going
past the passive rate (a coin/fish sink, not a wall).

Pure functions only — no DB, no Discord — so the regen math is unit-testable.
The persisted state is ``(energy:int, updated_at:unix)`` on
``mining_player_state``; the *effective* energy at any instant is computed from
elapsed time by :func:`settle` (we store a value + a timestamp, never a
background ticker — ADR-001/002: no external state, no scheduler dependency).

Ported verbatim from the oracle ``utils/mining/energy.py``; mirrors the
already-ported ``sb/domain/fishing/energy.py`` seam-for-seam (the oracle keeps
the two copies separate by a deliberate rule-of-three note — the ONLY
differences are the mining constants and the ``restore`` / ``restore_value`` /
``seconds_until`` food additions). This slice is the pure domain core only: no
persistence, no command wiring, no golden — those are later, owner-gated slices
(``docs/scoping/energy-system-scope.md``).
