"""Seed-deterministic procedural mine grid — pure (the grid Mine port).

Ported verbatim from the oracle ``disbot/utils/mining/grid.py`` (hub-redesign
PR 3, Q-0173): the *spatial* half of the mining world. Where
:mod:`sb.domain.mining.world` owns the vertical depth↔biome mapping (``z``),
this module owns the LATERAL grid (``x``, ``y``) at a given depth and the
deterministic content of every cell.

Owner design (Q-0173 — oracle ``docs/planning/mining-hub-redesign-2026-06-15.md``):

* **Seed-deterministic procedural** — a cell's content is a pure function of
  the world *seed* and its ``(x, y, z)`` coordinates, so ``seed 12345`` gives
  everyone the same world (deterministic · shareable · effectively infinite).
* **One shared grid per seed** — the seed is per-guild
  (``store.get_world_seed``), so every player in a guild roams the same world.
* **The vertical axis = the existing depth bands** — ``z`` is the depth-band
  index (:mod:`sb.domain.mining.world`); "deeper = richer" carries over via
  :func:`sb.domain.mining.rewards.ore_weights_for_depth`.
* **v1 = free movement, NO encounters** — this module models cell *content*
  (a richness multiplier + a featured ore), never an encounter system.

Pure: stdlib only, no Discord, no DB, no global RNG — every cell is
reproducible from ``(seed, x, y, z)``, so it is trivially unit-testable.
