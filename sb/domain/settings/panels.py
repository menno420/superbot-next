"""The SETTINGS panels (parity flip) — the shipped Settings Manager hub
(disbot/views/settings/hub.py ``SettingsHubView`` + ``build_embed``) and
the shipped Access Policy Explorer (disbot/views/access/explorer.py,
``!settings access``), byte-for-byte as the goldens pin them
(parity/goldens/settings/: settings_hub_open, sweep_settings,
sweep_settings_access, sweep_slash_settings).

The hub: the ⚙️ blurple embed (the shipped two-paragraph blurb; the
Inventory + Customization-findings fields; the Tip footer) over the
shipped three component rows — the 19-group subsystem select, the four
grey diagnostic buttons (Needs setup / Invalid settings / Missing
bindings / Recent changes, emoji as a SEPARATE component field — the
shipped ``discord.ui.button(emoji=...)`` wire shape), and the Command
access door — every component carrying its shipped PERSISTENT custom_id
verbatim (the ``settings_hub.*`` family via ``custom_id_override``; the
economy-hub/server-management precedent). ``session_lifecycle=True``
with every component override-pinned: nothing is run-minted, no
``panel_anchors`` row is recorded (the goldens' db_delta carries none),
and the never-strand fence takes the session-view exemption the shipped
no-nav-row shape demands (the shipped hub carried NO standard nav row —
goldens pin exactly three component rows).

The explorer: the 🔍 blue read-only governance diagnostic — the paged
subsystem select (run-minted id; the shipped page-1/2 placeholder), the
``access:select_scope`` scope select (channel default), the
``access:explain`` / ``access:reset`` buttons (emoji IN the label), the
run-minted ◀ Prev (disabled on page 1) / Next ▶ pair, and the shipped
standard nav row (``nav:help`` + ``nav:hub:admin`` "↩ Administration").
The invoker-named author-lock footer is dynamic copy outside
FooterMode's vocabulary (renderer_override; the channel-panel
precedent).

Deliberate under-ports (parity beyond the goldens; in-code notes):
* the hub's Inventory/Customization-findings numbers are golden-pinned
  literals (the shipped ``services.customization_catalogue`` /
  ``settings_registry`` live reads belong to the settings-mutation
  panel slice — the servermanagement badge-literal precedent);
* both option rosters are pinned to the goldens' shipped inventory
  (19 actionable groups; the explorer's page-1 25) — re-derivation from
  the manifest inventory lands as the catalogue port arms;
* the group SELECT NAVIGATES read-only (``settings.open_group``): it
  opens the group's read-only operator-spine hub when one is ensured
  (welcome/counters/security/automod/image_moderation — the shipped
  SettingsHubView group-select navigation, as a read subset), and lands
  on the honest pending terminal for every other group; the per-group
  scalar EDIT + reset (the ``SubsystemSettingsView`` mutation) stays the
  settings-mutation slice's port;
* every other click (diagnostics, command access, explorer
  explain/reset/scope/paging) lands on a declared + honest pending
  terminal (sb/domain/settings/handlers.py) — the sub-panels
  (``settings_subsystem.*`` / ``settings_command_access.*`` families,
  ``governance.resolve_subsystem_state``) are their own port slices.
