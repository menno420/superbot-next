# Deep-mining WRITE-PARITY lane claim — `mining-write-parity-lane`

> **✅ EXEMPTIONS COMPLETE (2026-07-13)** — all six planned slices DELIVERED
> (WP-4 folded into WP-3 per spec). Every `depth.exemptions.mining`
> `guard-only-capture` row is retired; the mining exemption block is empty of
> tables. **WP-7 (below, IN FLIGHT)** is a coverage-deepening follow-on: it
> ports the residual non-energy pending WRITE legs (respec / craft) that the
> lane left honest-pending, minting goldens that drive their mutations — it
> retires NO exemption (their tables are already covered) and does not change

> **CLAIM (2026-07-12T21:33:48Z)** — born-red placeholder, DRAFT PR, NO
> implementation. This lane claims the deep-mining **write-golden parity** work

This lane succeeds the completed COMMAND ladder (`slice1-equip-loadout-character`,
#286→#300). The ladder ported all 26 mining deep-system commands' READ/guard
surface; this lane covers their WRITE surface. Six planned slices, one PR each,
parked green (the ladder cadence). One bullet per slice, parseable by
`check_claims` (backticked token + ISO date). Full scope:
`scratchpad/write-parity-scope.md`.

**EXCLUDED — cook / use.** The `!cook` / `!use` argful writes depend on the
un-ported mining energy/consumable system (a **separate lane**) and stay honest
D-0043 pending terminals; they register no covered store, so there is NO exemption
to retire. This lane does NOT touch them.

**Exemptions retired by lane end (8 `guard-only-capture` rows):**
`mining_player_state`, `mining_equipment`, `mining_gear_wear`,
`mining_loadout_presets`, `player_skills`, `mining_world`, `mining_vault`,
`mining_structures`.
