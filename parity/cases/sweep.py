"""Mechanical breadth sweep — one golden per enumerable command.

The denominator comes from the live bot object (``bot.walk_commands()`` /
``bot.tree.walk_commands()``), so the sweep can never quietly diverge from
the real registered surface. For each command we synthesize a plausible
invocation from its signature; commands whose parameters we cannot
synthesize are reported as an explicit uncovered class, never silently
skipped.
